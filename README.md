# DSA-Practice (Python)

Welcome to my **DSA-Practice** repository! This repo contains my solutions and notes for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, primarily solved in **Python**. I’ve taken inspiration from different problem sets (including [Neetcode]) to sharpen my coding skills in preparation for technical interviews.

## Introduction

I’ve structured this repo around essential DSA categories, such as:

- **Arrays**
- **Binary Search**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Heap / Priority Queue**
- **Sorting**
- **Backtracking**
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Graphs**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Recursion**
- **Trees**

Each folder contains Python solutions, possibly with short explanations or notes to understand the underlying concepts. My main goals include:

- Practicing coding in a consistent style
- Learning and reviewing core data structures & algorithms
- Building a reference library for future interview prep
